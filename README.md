# Perlin-Noise-Java-Simplified
A short version of perlin noise in java, this is for 2D and lower(for lower just enter 0 for y)

To use, simply instantiate the class somewhere else and enter the parameters for the method either octaveNoise
or perlinNoise, octaveNoise you can have more control over

for the SavedValues.seed bit, simply change it to a long type number
